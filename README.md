This was a project for university that I actually ended up liking. I can admit it isn't my best work but it was still a very fun project. The project was for a 3 pasrt assignment on algorithms and this was for the path finding algorithm section, I believe the algorithm I made here was my attempt at an A-Star search. After revising the algorithm it's more like a greedy best first search but I don't think I will be revisiting this project to improve it.
